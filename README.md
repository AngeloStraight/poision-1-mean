# poision-1-mean
We conduct experiments from the study that was performed on poisoning a geometric data sets. In the research paper Algorithms for Poisoning Geometric Data Sets, we have an algorithm for poisoning 1 mean clustering. This paper will run analysis on iris data, diabetes data and random generated data. All of theses experiments are con- ducted in R2 Euclidean space
